## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Q: Fractal analysis shows "failed" or no results**
A: Try with a longer, more complex audio file. Simple tones may not provide enough data for analysis.

**Q: Safety protocols won't let me use high frequencies**  
A: Check your experience level setting. Beginners are limited to safe frequencies only.

**Q: Volume automatically reduces and I can't increase it**
A: This is intentional safety protection. High frequencies require subtle volumes.

**Q: Documentation session won't start**
A: Ensure you're playing audio and have enabled documentation mode in settings.

**Q: Test tones don't play**
A: Check browser audio permissions and try reducing volume first.

**Q: Mobile interface is cramped**
A: Use landscape mode and zoom out. Mobile experience is optimized for basic usage.

### Performance Issues

**Slow analysis**: Large audio files take longer. Consider shorter samples for faster results.

**Memory usage**: Clear browser cache and restart if experiencing slowdown.

**Audio dropouts**: High frequencies with complex processing may cause glitches on slower devices.
